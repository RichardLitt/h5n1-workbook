# HPAI Workbook

This is a science workbook for me to think through stuff related to H5N1 research, and to save scripts that come up along the way.

## How to use this

For now, I am running the text as Jupytext, in order to be rendered in a Jupyter Notebook. It's a bit clunky, but it at least allows us to tell a story with the data.

1. Clone this repository
2. In your terminal, run `jupyter notebook`.
3. Open `notebooks/intro.r` as a Jupytext book.
4. You'll need to get access to the data, too. I can't upload all of the data to this repository for privacy and copyright reasons. Ask me for the files.

## FAQ

### What about .ipynb_checkpoints and .Rproj files?

Ignore them. They're artefacts of the system or my workflow, for now.

### Are you going to host this?

Probably. But I need to get sign-off first from the RNBWS, and from eBird and others about storing the data. This whole thing may be better served as an RShiny app.

### What about writing your thesis?

This approaches that work by delving into the data itself. No, it's not perfect, academic English. One of the things I am unsure of is how much I am going to need to pare down the wordcount for the proposal.
